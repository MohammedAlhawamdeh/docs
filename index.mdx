### How It Works

1. **Marketing → Checkout**: Pricing buttons call `/api/checkout_sessions` → Stripe collects payment → webhooks sync to Supabase
2. **Access Control**: `lib/access.ts` checks subscriptions and one-time purchases
3. **Dashboard**: Server actions read RLS-protected data; middleware protects routes
4. **Email**: Auth emails via Resend with React Email templates
5. **SEO**: Centralized config powers metadata, sitemaps, and OG images
