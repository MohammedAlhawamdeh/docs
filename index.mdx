## KwikSaaS

Launch a branded SaaS with authentication, billing, email, analytics, and a polished marketing + dashboard experience out of the box.

<Tip>
Keep marketing content, plan data, and Stripe price IDs in sync to avoid checkout surprises.
</Tip>

### What’s inside

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (email/password, magic links, OAuth Google/GitHub), protected routes via middleware.
- **Billing**: Stripe Checkout + Customer Portal, subscriptions (monthly/yearly/trial) and one-time/lifetime, webhook-driven sync to Supabase.
- **Licensing & downloads**: License keys tied to purchases, gated downloads from Supabase Storage, GitHub collaborator access for Ultimate.
- **Emails**: Resend + React Email templates (magic link, reset, confirm, purchase receipt).
- **Content**: MDX blog, changelog, and legal pages with dynamic OG images and JSON-LD.
- **UI**: 50+ shadcn/radix components, marketing sections, dark mode, animated hero/pricing.
- **Analytics**: PostHog client + server helpers (disabled in dev by default).
- **SEO**: Central config, sitemap/robots, structured data, OG generation.

### How the pieces fit

- Marketing pages call `/api/checkout_sessions` → Stripe Checkout collects payment → Stripe webhooks write subscriptions/purchases to Supabase → license keys are minted and confirmation emails sent → downloads and GitHub access check license/subscription state.
- Dashboard uses Supabase client + server actions to read RLS-protected data; access gating is centralized in `lib/access.ts`.
- SEO/OG and analytics are opt-in and driven by centralized config in `src/lib/seo`.
