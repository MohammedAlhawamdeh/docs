## Deployment

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare env on the host">
Set all required variables (Supabase, Stripe, Resend, PostHog, GitHub if used) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com`.
</Step>

<Step title="Provision Supabase">
Create the project, run migrations, and ensure Storage buckets `download` and `avatars` exist. Add auth redirect URL: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Stripe production">
- Create production prices and map IDs in env.
- Add webhook endpoint `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe` with events `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.*`, `payment_intent.succeeded`.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Vercel (recommended)">
Connect the repo, add env vars, and deploy. Any other Next.js host works (Railway, Render, DO App Platform, AWS Amplify) with Node 18+.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify post-deploy">
- Auth flows redirect correctly.
- Checkout completes and webhook inserts rows.
- `/api/download` returns a signed URL for licensed users.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If Stripe price IDs differ between staging and prod, set the correct values per environment to avoid checkout failures.
</Warning>
