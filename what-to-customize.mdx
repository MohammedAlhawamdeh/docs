## What to Customize

This is your cheat sheet. It tells you exactly what to change to make KwikSaaS yours, and what you should leave untouched.

---

## ✅ You MUST Change These

These files contain placeholder branding that you need to replace with your own.

| File | What to Change | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/seo/config.ts` | Site name, tagline, URL, company info, social links | 🔴 Required |
| `src/config/site.config.ts` | Site metadata and company details | 🔴 Required |
| `.env.local` | Your Supabase, Stripe, and Resend API keys | 🔴 Required |
| `public/logos/logo.svg` | Replace with your logo | 🔴 Required |
| `src/content/legal/*.mdx` | Privacy policy, Terms of Service | 🔴 Required |

<Warning>
  **Don't launch without updating these files.** They contain demo branding and placeholder legal text.
</Warning>

---

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZE These (Your Content)

Update these to match your product and marketing.

| File/Folder | What's There | What to Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/config/marketing.config.ts` | Hero text, features, FAQ, testimonials | Edit with your copy |
| `src/app/(marketing)/sections/` | Landing page sections | Customize or replace |
| `src/content/blog/` | Demo blog posts | Delete demos, add your posts |
| `src/content/changelog/` | Demo changelog entries | Delete demos, add your own |
| `public/logos/logo-dark.svg` | Dark mode logo | Replace if needed |
| `src/app/globals.css` | Theme colors (CSS variables) | Match your brand colors |
| `src/components/shared/logo.tsx` | Logo component | Update with your SVG |

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Start with `marketing.config.ts` — it controls most of the landing page content from one file.
</Tip>

---

## ⚠️ MODIFY with Care

These control core functionality. Change them, but understand what you're changing.

| File | What It Does | When to Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/payments/plans.ts` | Pricing plans and Stripe price IDs | When setting up your pricing |
| `src/config/plans.config.ts` | Plan definitions for access gating | When changing plan features |
| `src/components/shared/header.tsx` | Navigation links | When adding/removing nav items |
| `src/components/shared/footer.tsx` | Footer links and info | When updating footer |
| `src/components/dashboard/app-sidebar.tsx` | Dashboard navigation | When adding dashboard pages |

<Warning>
  **Keep plans in sync.** If you change `plans.ts`, make sure `plans.config.ts` and your Stripe products match.
</Warning>

---

## 🚫 DON'T Touch These

Leave these alone unless you're an experienced developer making intentional changes.

| Folder/File | Why Not to Touch |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/supabase/` | Core Supabase client factories — they work |
| `src/lib/payments/stripe.ts` | Stripe integration — tested and working |
| `src/lib/access.ts` | Access control logic — handles subscriptions |
| `src/lib/email/` | Email sending — integrated with Resend |
| `src/components/ui/` | shadcn/radix UI components — don't modify |
| `src/app/api/` | API routes (checkout, webhooks, etc.) — working |
| `src/app/(auth)/actions.ts` | Auth server actions — leave as-is |
| `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` | Route protection — critical for security |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Database schema — don't edit existing files |

<Info>
  These are the "boilerplate" parts. They're designed to just work. Focus your energy on the customization files above.
