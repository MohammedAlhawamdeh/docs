## Technical Notes & Improvements

## Caveats

- **Rate limiting**: In-memory only; not suitable for multi-region/serverless scale. Replace with Redis/KV (e.g., Upstash) for production.
- **Plan definitions**: Duplicated across `lib/payments/plans.ts`, `config/plans.config.ts`, and marketing pricing; keep in sync with Stripe price IDs.
- **Download file naming**: `/api/download` assumes `kwiksaas-boilerplate-main.zip` in bucket `download`; update constants if file name/version changes.
- **Stripe API version**: Pinned to `2025-11-17.clover`; monitor for breaking changes.
- **PostHog**: Disabled in development or when key is missing; set keys before expecting tracking.
- **GitHub access**: Requires PAT with repo admin; endpoint will fail silently without envs.

## Suggested improvements

- Externalize rate limiting to Redis and share across instances.
- Centralize plan data to a single source consumed by marketing, pricing, and webhook logic.
- Parameterize download version/file name in config/env.
- Add tests for checkout→webhook→Supabase writes, download gating, GitHub access, and auth callback flows.
- Add observability around webhook failures and email sending.
