## Get Running in 5 Minutes

This is the fastest path to seeing KwikSaaS in action. You only need **Supabase** to start — Stripe and Resend can be added later.

<Info>
  **TL;DR:** Clone → Set 3 env vars → Run. That's it.

## Step 1: Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAlhawamdeh/kwiksaas.git
cd kwiksaas
npm install
```

<Check>
  Takes about 1-2 minutes depending on your connection.
</Check>

## Step 2: Create Supabase Project

<Steps>
<Step title="Create project">
1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Pick a name, set a password, choose a region
4. Wait ~2 minutes for it to spin up
</Step>

<Step title="Copy your keys">
Go to **Settings → API** and grab these 3 values:

| What to copy | Where to paste |
| --- | --- |
| Project URL | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` |
| `anon` public key | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` |
| `service_role` secret | `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` |
</Step>

<Step title="Configure auth redirects">
Go to **Authentication → URL Configuration**:

- **Site URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Redirect URLs:** Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
</Step>

<Step title="Run database migration">
Option A (Recommended):
```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
npx supabase db push
```

Option B (Manual):
Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/*.sql` and run in Supabase SQL Editor.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and fill in the 3 Supabase values you copied:

```bash
# Required - Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=eyJ...

# Required - Site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Everything else is optional for now!
```

<Tip>
  **Stripe and Resend are optional.** The app works without them — you just won't have payments or custom emails yet.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Run It!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 🎉

---

## Verify It's Working

| Test | How |
| --- | --- |
| Homepage loads | Visit `/` — you should see the landing page |
| Auth works | Go to `/sign-up`, create an account |
| Dashboard works | After signing in, you land on `/dashboard` |

<Check>
  **You're done!** The app is running with full auth. Time to make it yours.
</Check>
